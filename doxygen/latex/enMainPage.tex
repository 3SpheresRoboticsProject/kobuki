\section{\-Overview}\label{koMainPage_Overview}
\-The kobuki driver is a simple c++ library that allows interfacing to the kobuki mobile research base. \-Before\subsection{\-Target audience}\label{enMainPage_who}
\-This documentation is targeted for users creating a custom robot on top of kobuki using either posix/win32 or an apple operating system. \-If that is you, you are in the right place -\/ proceed to the guides below. \-If you're interested in developing a driver for a custom unsupported platform (e.\-g. vxworks) then you'll want to check the serial protocol reference in the \doxyref{appendix}{p.}{enAppendixProtocolSpecification}.

\-Alternatively, if you're using a {\itshape kobuki reference platform\/}, check one of the links below.

\-Firstly, note that the library isn't designed to run your control loop. \-Robots are quite varied -\/ everything from something really simple running on very minimal embedded resources to a fully fledged system. \-There is also a wide variety of architectures that a driver must neatly integrate with, so we have left the decision on how to design and integrate the driver up to the user. \-To that end, the driver is simply a library of classes, simple functions and callback oriented \doxyref{sigslots}{p.}{enSigslotsGuide}.

\-We have a simple implementation in the guides below and a more detailed implementation can be found for the {\tt kobuki\-\_\-node} that runs within the ros framework.\section{\-Guides}\label{koMainPage_Guides}

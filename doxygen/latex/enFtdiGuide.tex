\section{\-Overview}\label{enFtdiGuide_ftdiOverview}
\-Kobuki provides two different interfaces for communication with host(e.\-g. \-Netbook), \-U\-S\-B and \-Serial port. \-But underlying scheme is same. \-It is {\tt \-R\-S-\/232} {\tt serial communication}.

\-Kobuki has `\-U\-S\-B to serial converter` internally, {\tt \-F\-T\-D\-I}'s {\tt \-F\-T232\-R}. \-By using this chip, kobuki and host can communicate over \-U\-S\-B interface.\section{\-Detailed Infomartion}\label{enFtdiGuide_ftdiDetailedInformation}
\-More detailed desciptions can be found in the {\tt code api} of {\tt kobuki\-\_\-ftdi}.

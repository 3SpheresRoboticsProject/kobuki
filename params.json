{"name":"Kobuki","tagline":"Kobuki Software Documentation","body":"### Introduction\r\n\r\nKobuki documentation is located in several places - this domain hosts only the software driver documentation. This should be of interest if you are either\r\n\r\n* Compiling or cross-compiling the c++ driver and building your own implementation on top.\r\n* Developing the c++ driver itself.\r\n* Writing a non-c++ driver implementation for kobuki.\r\n\r\nIf you are one of these users, head straight to the [doxygen](doxygen/index.html). Guides and api documentation can be found therein.\r\n\r\n### Other Documentation Sources\r\n\r\nFor other sources of documentation:\r\n\r\n* [Official Kobuki Home](http://kobuki.yujinrobot.com) - about, sales, specifications and hardware howtos.\r\n* [Ros Documentation](http://ros.org/wiki/kobuki) - kobuki in Ros.\r\n* [Turtlebot Documentation](http://ros.org/wiki/Robots/TurtleBot) - a full reference platform implementation for kobuki.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!

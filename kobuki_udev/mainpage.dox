@section Eeprom

We will program this into the chip at the factory. The utility programs in src help us do that
but currently don't work for R232RL type chips. The example ftdi program works though, so there
should be a good hint as to how to proceed there.

@section Udev

We simply copy across a udev rule to kickstart /dev/kobuki.

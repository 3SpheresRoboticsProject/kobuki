\section Launchers

Goal is to replicate the minimal.launch, kinect.launch, turtlebot.launch(?) in turtlebot_brinup. Eventually we should be almost exactly the same.

\seciton Minimal

- Obviously, kobuki_node replaces turtlebot node here.
- Namespaced in kobuki

Forgetting the namespace - too many absolute or global references and also android doesn't play nicely with that.
 
\section Kinect

- Got rid of the kinect breaker - do we really need?
- Namespaced in kobuki
